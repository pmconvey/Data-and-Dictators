# "I completed collecting data on election dates for leaders in Archigos for
# the period 1919 - 2006 (in cvs format). The file contains data for the
# earlier period 1900 - 1918 but I do not claim this is comprehensive or
# complete. This data is not yet integrated in Archigos. I would appreciate
# feedback on omissions, mistakes and addenda. An effort is underway to
# upgrade and extend this data, this upgraded version should become available
# by the late Fall of 2009."
